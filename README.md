# My Personal Project - Reference Manager

## About the project
The application is for artists to better manage any pictures and colour palettes
they use as a reference for their art.

SKETCH OF IDEA: ![img.png](img.png)
- **What will the application do?**

The application will allow the user to upload reference pictures they use often (such as action poses, backgrounds, characters, etc.)
and organize them into folders for easier access. Folders can also be within folders.
The user can also create and save colour palettes (eg. greyscale colour palette, sunset, pastel, etc.)
to refer to when colouring. For example, if I am creating an artwork that has a sunset atmosphere,
I may choose to create a colour palette called "Sunset" and save colours that work well together
like orange, purple, red, yellow, etc. to refer to when coloring. I can then refer to the same
colour palette in future art pieces that have a sunset atmosphere.

EXTRA FEATURE IF TIME ALLOWS: The application will allow users to select a few reference photos
or colour palettes of their choosing for the artwork they're currently working on,
then pull it out onto a separate window. In that separate window, the user can use
an "eye-dropper" tool to select pixels on the pictures, and get their HEX
or RGB values so they can use it in their own artwork.
- **Who will use it?**

Artists (mainly digital artists, but traditional artists too (although the colour palette
feature will probably be of less use to traditional artists since they can't directly refer to
rgb's and hex codes))

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

I LOVE art, and I want to make artists' lives just a liiittle easier (no, I am NOT looking at you, AI art).
Having to open 5000 google chrome tabs to search up
an image for each tab, and have to jump between tabs as they try to look at multiple
references at once is an absolute headache. Hence, having it all in one place will be
much easier. And, saving too many pictures onto your camera roll 1) takes up space,
and 2) will be drowned out by other photos.
Copy and pasting the references directly onto their canvas is an alternative,
but it ends up taking a lot of space on the canvas, and if the artist chooses to zoom in
at a part of their drawing, then they can't see the reference unless they keep zooming in
and out.
More of a personal reason, I draw on my phone, so directly copy and pasting references onto
my canvas board takes up too much space on such a small screen, and drawing on a phone means
I have to always be super zoomed in on my drawing so zooming in and out is VERY inconvenient
just to look at some reference pictures.
That's why I search up references on my laptop instead.
